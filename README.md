# Dark Torch

A lightweight extension for the virtual tabletop platform
[Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/), designed specifically for
[Shadowdark](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/collections/shadowdark-rpg/products/shadowdark-rpg)
RPG adventures. Dark Torch allows you to easily track real-world torch or light
source durations at the table, seamlessly bringing Shadowdark’s one-hour torch
mechanic to your online game.

## Features

- **Real-time torch countdown:** Timer defaults to one hour, matching Shadowdark
  torch durations.
- **Pause and resume:** The timer can be paused and resumed at any point.
- **Adjust timer:** Modify the remaining time manually, to account for in-game
  changes.
- **Visibility options:** Timer display can be limited to GM only or shown to
  all players.
- **Display modes:** Choose between standard numeric countdown or a thematic
  hourglass visualization.
- **Permission controls:** By default, only the GM can manage the torch timer,
  but this can be configured to allow players.
- **Shadowdark-inspired style:** UI mimics the look and feel of the Shadowdark
  core book.
