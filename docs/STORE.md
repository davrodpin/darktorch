# Dark Torch

Real-time torch timer for Shadowdark RPG, built for the Owlbear Rodeo virtual
tabletop.

Dark Torch brings Shadowdark's one-hour torch mechanic directly into your online
game. Track torch and light source duration in real time so everyone at the
table always knows how much light is left.

## Features

- **Real-time torch countdown**: Timer defaults to one hour, matching Shadowdark
  torch durations.
- **Pause and resume**: Pause the timer at any point and resume when the party
  moves again.
- **Adjustable duration**: Manually modify the remaining time to account for
  time passing in game.
- **Display modes**: Choose between a clean numeric countdown or a thematic
  hourglass view.
- **Visibility options**: Show the timer only to the GM or to all players at the
  table.
- **Permission controls**: Restrict timer control to the GM or optionally allow
  players to manage it.
- **Shadowdark-inspired style**: UI is styled to evoke the look and feel of the
  Shadowdark core book.

## How it works

- Start a torch timer that counts down one hour of real-world time.
- Use the controls to pause, resume, reset, or adjust the remaining time as
  needed.
- Switch between numeric and hourglass displays depending on your table's
  preference.
- Choose whether only the GM sees and controls the timer, or if the whole party
  does.

## Using Dark Torch in Owlbear Rodeo

1. Install the extension in Owlbear Rodeo by adding the manifest URL:
   `https://davrodpin.github.io/darktorch/manifest.json`.
2. Open the Dark Torch popover from the Owlbear Rodeo extensions menu.
3. Start the torch timer when the party lights a torch or other time-limited
   light source.
4. Pause or adjust the timer whenever time passes in-game (rest, exploration,
   backtracking, etc.).
5. Keep an eye on the countdown so you know exactly when the dungeon goes dark.
